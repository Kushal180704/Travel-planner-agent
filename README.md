Intelligent Travel Planner Agent
An AI-powered travel companion that generates dynamic, personalized, and optimized itineraries.

Overview
This project is an intelligent agent designed to revolutionize the travel planning experience. It moves beyond static itinerary generators by using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP), real-time data aggregation, and multi-objective optimization to create adaptable and highly personalized travel plans. The agent acts as a true companion, capable of dynamically re-planning in response to real-world events like flight delays or unforeseen closures.

Features
Natural Language Interaction: Users can describe their travel plans in plain English via a conversational interface.

Personalized Itineraries: The agent generates day-by-day plans tailored to the user's interests, budget, and travel style.

Real-time Data Integration: Integrates with APIs for flights, hotels, attractions, weather, and traffic to ensure the most up-to-date recommendations.

Dynamic Re-planning: Automatically and intelligently adjusts the itinerary when faced with unexpected events (e.g., flight delays, museum closures).

Multi-objective Optimization: Balances conflicting goals such as minimizing cost, reducing travel time, and maximizing activities.

Explainable AI: Provides clear, human-readable justifications for its recommendations.

System Architecture & Methodology
The system is built on a modular architecture:

User Interface: A chatbot or web interface for natural language interaction.

NLP & Intent Recognition: Processes user queries to extract key intents and entities (e.g., destination, dates, interests).

Data Aggregation Layer: Consolidates information from various external APIs (Google Maps, Booking.com, OpenWeatherMap, etc.).

Optimization Engine: A custom-built algorithm that generates the itinerary by balancing multiple constraints and objectives.

Dynamic Re-planning Module: A logic layer that monitors real-time events and triggers the optimization engine to create a revised plan if necessary.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

Access to necessary API keys (e.g., Google Maps, Booking.com, OpenWeatherMap).

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-planner-agent.git
cd travel-planner-agent
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys:

Maps_API_KEY=your_key_here
BOOKING_COM_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_key_here
Usage
To run the application, execute the following command:

Bash

python app.py
This will start the web server. You can then interact with the agent through your browser or a specified endpoint.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Flask: A lightweight web framework for the backend.

SpaCy: For Natural Language Processing.

Requests: For handling API calls.

Google Maps API: For location and route data.

Booking.com API: For accommodation data.

OpenWeatherMap API: For weather data.
